# Math Engine

This is the math engine for the calculator. I wrote this package for fun, you also just can go to pub.dev and use a package from there. This package does not support every feature, but it has everything needed for the calculator.

## Features

- Calculate basic math operations.

## Getting started

1. Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file.
```yaml
dependencies:
    math_engine: 
        path: ../math_engine/
```
2. Import the package
```dart
import 'package:math_engine/math_engine.dart';
```
3. Use the package
- See [Usage](#usage)


## Usage

TODO: Include short and useful examples for package users. Add longer examples
to `/example` folder. 

```dart
const like = 'sample';
```

## Additional information

I wrote this package just for fun and it is not published on pub.dev. I only use it for the calculator project.
